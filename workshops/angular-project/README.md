## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You should use the Angular 2+ TypeScript framework/library on the front-end. You have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information 
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
- You must also add some sort of **unit testing** and any other testing you desire to the project

## Building your project

When you build your project you will need to:

- Upload it to github 
- Deploy the code to a live site - ideally you should deploy using firebase
- Share both the github and livesite with us using this form by XX

### Support

We strongly encourage this to be a PEER learning experience. We encourage you to share thoughts and discussion on the [Discord Server]() and we will arrange regular check ins to chat as a group.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
