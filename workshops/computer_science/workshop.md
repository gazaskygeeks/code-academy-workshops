# Overview

#### _A set of learning objectives & exercises to guide self learning an introduction to Computer Science concepts (Data structures & algorithms)_

## Resources

- Learning objectives mostly taken from Rithm School's excellent free course: https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript-computer-science-fundamentals
- You should:
  - Read through each of the Rithm School workshops on each topic 
  - Do further research if you think you need to
  - Attempt the exercises
- Further useful reading can be found in many places, such as this Interview Cake course: https://www.interviewcake.com/table-of-contents

#### It should be noted that some of the tests in the exercises have been reported as faulty, so you may need to look closely if you can't get them to pass
