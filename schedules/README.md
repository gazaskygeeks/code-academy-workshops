This folder will hold schedules for weeks in the curriculum.

## Guidelines for adding a schedule:

1. Create a folder with the name of the week
2. Create a markdown README file within the folder, which should hold a table of the weeks schedule. You can use [this site](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to generate a table, or use the template below.
3. If the workshops already exist in this repo, please link to them in the schedule
4. Add to the list below a link to your schedule, in alphabetical order
5. Create PR of the above, and assign @m4v15 to merge & tell me on slack you have done so

Schedules:

- [Advanced React Week - Context API + Hooks](./advanced-react-week)

### Markdown Template for Table:
```md
|   	| Day 1 	| Day 2 	| Day 3 	| Day 4 	| Day 5 	|
|---	|-------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|-------	|
|   	|       	|       	|       	|       	|       	|
```
